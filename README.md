# pymolshortcuts4rna

This is the repository for ***pymolschortucts4rna.py***.
At this point in time, it is best to use  **pymolschortuctsnobs4.py** located [here](https://github.com/MooersLab/pymolshortcuts "/pymolshortcuts").

Advanced beginers who have started scripting should also consider using the snippet library, [pymolsnips](https://github.com/MooersLab/pymolsnips "pymolsnips"). 
It is available for 18 leading text editors.

The pdf of the slides from my presentation at the wonderful [**2019 ConrBelt Regional RNA Symposium**](https://rna-cornbelt-regional-meeting.webnode.com) at the University of Missouri, Columbia, MO on October 18th can be downloaded from [here](). Many thanks go to Brenda Peculis and Frank Schmidt for organizing and hosting this fantastic meeting. The  poster session was one of the best that I have ever experienced.
