# pymolshortcuts4rna

This is the repository for ***pymolschortucts4rna.py***.
At this point in time, it is best to use  **pymolschortuctsnobs4.py** located [here](https://github.com/MooersLab/pymolshortcuts "pymolshortcuts").

Advanced beginers who have started scripting should also consider using the snippet library, [pymolsnips](https://github.com/MooersLab/pymolsnips "pymolsnips"). 
It is available for 18 leading text editors.

The pdf of the slides from my presentation at the wonderful [**2019 ConrBelt Regional RNA Symposium**](https://rna-cornbelt-regional-meeting.webnode.com) at the University of Missouri, Columbia, MO on October 18th can be downloaded from [here](). Many thanks go to Brenda Peculis and Frank Schmidt for organizing and hosting this fantastic meeting. The  poster session was one of the best that I have ever experienced.

## Examples


The shortcut is listed on the top.

#### CR: filled rings colored by element. There are no presets for nucleic acids unde the **A** pulldown in the internal guie to the right.

#### FR: filled rings colored by sequence.

![U8FRBW](https://github.com/MooersLab/pymolshortcuts4RNA/blob/master/images/U8FRBW.png?raw=true "FR BW")


#### Ambient occlusion variants.
