# pymolshortcuts4rna

This is the repository for ***pymolschortucts4rna.py***.
The shortcuts are several letters that are mapped to a Python function that executes one to many lines of code.
They function like bash aliases or the 

Above you can find the PDF of the slides from my presentation at the [**2019 CornBelt Regional RNA Symposium**](https://rna-cornbelt-regional-meeting.webnode.com) at the University of Missouri, Columbia, MO. 
Many thanks go to Professors Brenda Peculis and Frank Schmidt for organizing and hosting this fantastic meeting. 
The poster session was one of the most enjoyable that I have ever experienced.


## Examples


The shortcut is listed on the top.


### U8;CR: filled rings colored by sequence. 

There are no presets for nucleic acids under the **A** pulldown in the internal gui to the right.
The CR shortcut provides a ribbon cartoon with filled rings. 
The nucleotides are colored by base sequence.

### FR: filled rings colored by element and BW: black and white cartoon for grayscale figures

The FR shortcut generates filled rings colored by atomic element.
The BW shortcut renders a black and white cartoon that is useful when the use of color would be expensive or when used with a colored ligand to emphasize the ligand.

### Ambient occlusion variants.

### Shortcuts for generating arrays of unit cells filled with symmetry mates.

Crystal packing diagrams are particularly relevant to the stacking of double helices, which can stack end-on-end.

#### Example of a stacking figure. Use the code revealed with *help BST* as a template.

#### Example of a coordinated metal. Use of the pearl effect with the radius of the opaque sphere set to 0.25. Use the code revealed with *help NAL* as a template.
